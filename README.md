## My process

As usual I designed this *mobile-first*, although there really weren't too many differences between screen sizes. 🤣

I did attempt a _more professional workflow_ by adhering to *good commits*. So trying to label them correctly, and doing one thing per commit. 

Usually I like to start by styling the *typography*, but found it made more sense to start with the *layout* here.

This gave me a much better idea of both the container and card space I was working with! 😃

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**.  

I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, _for a little bit_ 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! 💃 I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022.  I finally learned **JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset.  If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out **[Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT).**

Then I met an awesome group of fellow-learning devs, **The Explorers**.  This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now!  But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the coveted T-shirt! 🎉👕


In *2023* I've been boning up on **React**, and just taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!

One of those courses has seen me going back to **Python** - which I had treated as my _crutch language_ to understand JavaScript.  🤣  But I've been loving navigating in multiple languages.

Another challenge I am undertaking this year is [Exercism's](https://exercism.org/) **#12in23**.  This is a cool 😎 opportunity to _try out_ 12 different languages this year.  Each month has a theme, like **Functional February** and **Mechanical March** to encourage you to check out different language paradims.  I'm loving this chance to dip my toe in other types of programming.  I find I'm gaining the ability to evaluate various languages' strengths and project needs.
