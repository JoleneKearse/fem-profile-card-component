## My process

As usual I designed this *mobile-first*, although there really weren't too many differences between screen sizes. 🤣

I did attempt a _more professional workflow_ by adhering to *good commits*. So trying to label them correctly, and only doing one thing per commit. 😱

Usually I like to start by styling the *typography*, but found it made more sense to start with the *layout* here.

This gave me a much better idea of both the container and card space I was working with! 😃

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Positioning


### What I learned

Basically, my biggest win was not being so afraid of using `position: relative` and `position: absolute`! I usually only use these as a last resort, but I planned to use it for the background images right from the start.

### Continued development

I will continue working on only doing one change per commit. I will; promise! 🤞 I changed from simply typing `git add .` and quite liked it, but still find myself jumping from file to file and forgetting to commit. 🤣

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Author

Hiya! 👋 My name is **Jolene Kearse**.  

I was an **English as a Foreign Language Teacher** ️🌏🧑‍🏫 for over 15 years - so, yeah, _for a little bit_ 🤌...  I lived all over the world, including China, England & South Korea.

Now I'm an awesome **Software Engineer**! 💃 I'm a **proud, self-taught individual**. 

I'm also proud of how far I came in 2022.  I finally learned **JavaScript**! 🍻 _I had struggled for about a year before I finally could add that to my skillset.  If you're interested in an awesome 🔥 course check out **[Class Central's Bootcamp YouTube Playlist going through freeCodeCamp's Algorithms and Data Structures Certification](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLU3RKvMpgrSEoqVIV14K_zuinrIBcnCgT).**

Then I met an awesome group of fellow-learning devs, **The Explorers**.  This exposed me to the myriad and oft-confusing ways of using **Git** in a team - loving it now!  But also projects using so many kinds of tech that would've just blown my mind a year before 🤯 including:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind

I even participated in **[#Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)** and earned the coveted T-shirt! 🎉👕


In *2023* I've been boning up on **React**, and just taking so many courses to learn **Backend Development** and **navigate the process of earning my first tech job**!

One of those courses has seen me going back to **Python** - which I had treated as my _crutch language_ to understand JavaScript.  🤣  But I've been loving navigating in multiple languages.

Another challenge I am undertaking this year is [Exercism's](https://exercism.org/) **#12in23**.  This is a cool 😎 opportunity to _try out_ 12 different languages this year.  Each month has a theme, like **Functional February** and **Mechanical March** to encourage you to check out different language paradims.  I'm loving this chance to dip my toe in other types of programming.  I find I'm gaining the ability to evaluate various languages' strengths and project needs.
